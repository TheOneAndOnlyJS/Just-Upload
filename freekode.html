        Hello, today I'm going to speak about Freekode. Freekode is a site that tricks you into giving your 
        code/projects to Freekode, and they use it to sell to other people for money. The owner of this site is Adith Raghav,
        I am actually his friend and he tricked me into giving my hard-working code to him. Please if you do visit his site dont 
        upload posts because he will do many things with it, I gave him so many things for free and he is demanding money from me

    </p>
    <p>Adith Raghav has seen my blog about him and has wrote nonsense let me see what he has wrote about me</p>
    <p>So first he says that the COVID-19 website is a copy from other websites. First of all I made this website back in 2020 when the pandamic was really serious
        so I made that website to help people and keep safe from COVID-19, so a lot of people may have the same idea and he says its copy.</p>
    <p>Now second he says in his lines "I created a framework of more than 12,000 lines of code that would help him make his website look great." I agreed a deal with him
        if he made all those lines of code I would give him payment which I did for the website Freekode by uploading post, but guess what he deleted all of those posts
        and told me I did not give him anything.</p>
    <p>Then last of all he says "Then, after months of me helping him out in every bit of code, he showed his true colors." Well first he was the one who started all this he said some
        cookie policy some nonsense and kicked me out and deleted my post that looked "useless" to his site, I made basic stuff because he wanted that so people can learn from that easy code.
        And when he asked for payment I told I did give it to him but he deleted all my posts on the spot without even looking what the posts were. He asked me about this blog and
        said since I kept this for months now he will too keep it for months.</p> 
    <p>But then again if he hadn't argued about his payment and talked all that useless thing none of this would even happen</p>
    <p>He has made awesome websites which look very cool you can visit the site but never make a deal with him, his webites are awesome not him</p>

    <p>If you do have a doubt about this you can email me at justacode123@gmail.com. What I'm saying is true and I dont want other
        poeple falling for this trap, dont sign into Freekode nothing just ignore it.
    </p>
    <p>More about Adith Raghav: If you dont know Adith Raghav keeps on asking you to do work and post and if you dont 
        he threatens he will delete your account and take your projects to take advantage. This is what happend to me. I didn't put some posts on his website
        and he used my code and doesn't give it back even thought its my property. I would suggest you to upload your projects
        on codepen.io, its much safer and your dont need to worry about anything.
    </p>
    <p>Just some weeks ago he threatend me that if I come to his site he will change the code of my website using some app he uses to hack 
        into other database and change code. He exactly did this to me and made my site very ugly. I changed the code back and made it look
        good again. So if you do want to upload your projects to the internet and dont want people like Adith threatening
        you, upload your projects on Github or Codepen.
