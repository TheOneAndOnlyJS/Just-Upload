        Hello, today I'm going to speak about Freekode. Freekode is a site that tricks you into giving your 
        code/projects to Freekode, and they use it to sell to other people for money. The owner of this site is Adith Raghav,
        I am actually his friend and he tricked me into giving my hard-working code to him. Please if you do visit his site dont 
        upload posts because he will do many things with it, I gave him so many things for free and he is demanding money from me

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Freekode</p>

    <p>If you do have a doubt about this you can email me at justacode123@gmail.com. What I'm saying is true and I dont want other
        poeple falling for this trap, dont sign into Freekode nothing just ignore it.
    </p>
    <p>More about Adith Raghav: If you dont know Adith Raghav keeps on asking you to do work and post and if you dont 
        he threatens he will delete your account and take your projects to take advantage. This is what happend to me. I didn't put some posts on his website
        and he used my code and doesn't give it back even thought its my property. I would suggest you to upload your projects
        on codepen.io, its much safer and your dont need to worry about anything.
    </p>
