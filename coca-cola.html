<p>Dr. John Stith Pemberton gave the world its best-known taste of “Coca-Cola”. 
    Dr. Pemberton never appreciated the capability of the drink that he had made, 
    and he gradually sold his business to 
    different partners and in 1888 just before his death, he sells his rest interest to Asa Candler.</p>

    <p>The Pemberton’s partner and accountant Frank M. 
        Robinson advised that the logo should employ 2 Cs in Coca-Cola rather than using 
        Coca-Cola. As per Coke’s website, Robinson 
        was also accountable for engrossing the logo.</p>

    <p>Assuming this product can be passed from your family; 
        Pemberton has demanded her son Charlie to own some of 
        the company’s. For a moment, Pemberton handled that his 
        son’s company’s ownership, during another company was permitted to use the method.</p>

          Atlanta, Georgia, Who would know that he was manufacturing one of the world’s most famous products? When he sold his creation in his soda fountain, he named
           it because he thought that two would look well, thus giving birth to Coca-Cola signals.</p>
