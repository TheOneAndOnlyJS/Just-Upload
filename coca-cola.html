<p>Dr. John Stith Pemberton gave the world its best-known taste of ‚ÄúCoca-Cola‚Äù. 
    Dr. Pemberton never appreciated the capability of the drink that he had made, 
    and he gradually sold his business to 
    different partners and in 1888 just before his death, he sells his rest interest to Asa Candler.</p>

    <p>The Pemberton‚Äôs partner and accountant Frank M. 
        Robinson advised that the logo should employ 2 Cs in Coca-Cola rather than using 
        Coca-Cola. As per Coke‚Äôs website, Robinson 
        was also accountable for engrossing the logo.</p>

    <p>Assuming this product can be passed from your family; 
        Pemberton has demanded her son Charlie to own some of 
        the company‚Äôs. For a moment, Pemberton handled that his 
        son‚Äôs company‚Äôs ownership, during another company was permitted to use the method.</p>
